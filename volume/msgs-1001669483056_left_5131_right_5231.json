    "text": "🌟 Конференции: ключевой элемент HR стратегии вашего бизнеса\n\nСегодня конференции становятся неотъемлемой частью HR стратегии компаний. Они не просто собирают людей в одном месте, но и служат мощным инструментом повышения осведомленности о бренде. Время реальной коммуникации становится все более ценным, и конференции отлично подходят для этого.\n\nНа таких ивентах можно не только обсудить важные вопросы, но и узнать, кто стоит за работой компании, пообщаться с ее представителями и представить себя игрокам индустрии. Важно помнить, что во многих компаниях работает огромное количество людей, и общение в переписке может отличаться от реальности. Поэтому важно хотя бы раз встретиться в живую. Здесь ключевым считается именно \"коннект\".\n\nПомимо налаживания деловых контактов, конференции помогают компаниям оставаться в рамках последних трендов и новостей. Ведь часто побеждает тот, кто понимает, что в данный момент актуально и что требуется рынку.\n\nДля LENKEP реальная коммуникация и живое общение — неотъемлемая часть нашего подхода❤️ Мы стремимся к тому, чтобы каждое первое впечатление было незабываемым и создавало основу для прочных деловых связей. Мы ценим нашу репутацию и поэтому активно участвуем в международных конференциях уже два года.\n\nНаша команда побывала в Дубае, на Мальте, в Лондоне и даже в Бразилии! За плечами нашей команды более 20 конференций🚀\n\nПрисоединяйтесь к нам, чтобы быть в курсе последних новостей и трендов в мире подбора персонала и HR индустрии! \n\nА если хотите узнать больше или обсудить сотрудничество, встречи на предстоящих конференциях пишите 👉🏼 @lenkep_art",
